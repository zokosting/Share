# WebRTC File Sharing

WebRTC File Sharing is a web application that enables peer-to-peer connections through web browsers, allowing users to share files directly between clients without intermediaries. By simply opening the website, users can upload files for distribution and share direct download links with others. Additionally, you can send a page with all your files that are currently being distributed.

## Features

- Peer-to-peer file sharing without the need for centralized servers.
- Share files by generating direct download links to be sent to others.
- Explore pages with multiple files currently being distributed.

## Getting Started

To use WebRTC File Sharing, simply open the application in your web browser. No installation or additional software is required. Follow the steps below to get started:

- Go to WebRTC File Sharing (replace "your-web-app-url" with the actual URL).
- Drag and drop a file you want to share onto the page.
- The file will be uploaded, and a direct download link will be generated.
- Share the download link with others to allow them to download the file directly.
